# Iximiel's Minimization Hub

In this repository I'm making a repository of minimization algorithm, trying to use only the c++ std library, I know it is not wise, but it can be sees as a challenge.

I am implementing a few of minimization algorithms and some test function to demostrate that they works.

## Minimization algorithm implemented:

- Nelder-Mead method as a template method

## Tests implemented:

- 2D Himmelblau
- 2D Rosenbrock
